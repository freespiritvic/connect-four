  <p><b id="instruct">Instructions</b>: Connect Four is played on a grid, 7 wide by 6 deep, with two players, 1 <span id="colorR">red</span> and 2 <span id="colorB">blue</span>. The players alternate turns, dropping a piece of their color in the top of a column. The piece will fall down to the further-down unoccupied slot. The game is won when a player makes four in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game is a tie if the entire board fills up without a winner.</p>
